SOME BASIC INFO:

----------------------------------------------------------------

To compile, just run 

  make


If there are problems with compilation, run 

  make clean
  make

----------------------------------------------------------------

To run the code, run

  ./connect4 <arguments>

Arguments:
  - no arguments: a game will be run between human and 
    the simple AI player I included here (called "simple")
  - 1 argument: a game will be run between human and the 
    specified player
  - 2 or more arguments: a tournament will be run between
    the specified players (doesn't work for human player well)

Examples:
  - just play against the simple player
    ./connect4
  - play against the offensive player
    ./connect4 offensive
  - play against the random player
    ./connect4 random
  - run a tournament with all supplied players
    ./connect4 simple offensive random better_random

----------------------------------------------------------------

List of supplied players:
  - simple        (best AI)
  - offensive     (second best AI)
  - random        (pure random)
  - better_random (slightly better version of random player)
  - human         (human player)

----------------------------------------------------------------

The time bound is 10 seconds for now, but this can be changed
in the main function. I have not tested the time bounds, but 
I hope it works. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

To add your player, follow these instructions:
  - create a separate source and header files for your player
  - the name of the file should be identical with your admiral 
    login name
  - to ensure there is no overlap with others, use your admiral
    login name as prefix of all your function names 
  - feel free to use any of my functions, but if you want to 
    ensure same functionality, you may want to create your own
    copy and rename it, because I may update my code
  - you can create other test players, for which you do not have
    to follow these naming conventions, but for your official
    player you should
  - to allow the system to use the player in tournaments and 
    games, you must add it into the list of players in 
    get_player.cc (should be self explanatory)

----------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: I spent lot of time testing the code, but there still
might be mistakes, so please report to me if you identify some
bugs in the code.
